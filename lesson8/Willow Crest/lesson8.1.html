            <span class="T">T</span>his happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling. About twelve
            o'clock a troop of ten or
            twelve thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive, slackening its speed, tried to
            clear the way with its cowâ€“catcher; but the mass of animals was too great. The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait, uttering now and then deafening bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them, for, having taken a particular direction,
            nothing can moderate and change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could contain.</p>
            <br>
         <p class="text2">The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but Phileas Fogg, who had the most reason of all to be in a hurry, remained in his seat,  and waited philosophically until it should please the buffaloes to get out of the way. Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to discharge his arsenal of revolvers upon them.</p>

I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his programme! And here's an engineer who doesn't dare to run the locomotive into this herd of beasts!"</p>
         <p class="text4">The engineer did not try to overcome the obstacle, and he was wise.</p>
